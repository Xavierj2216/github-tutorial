## Git vs. GitHub
**Git**- a version control that keeps "snapshots" of code/work, it doesn't require Github

**Github**- a open source that stores code in the cloud, helps you visually track changes, it requires Git

## Initial Setup
1) First you have to make a [github account](https://github.com/)

3) If you don't have a c9 account [press this to sign up](https://c9.io/) follow the steps to get a c9 account
4) Next we have to link c9 with github by going into c9.io > top-right > press gear icon > connected services > find Github and press connect
5) Now that you are connected, you can create your own workspace in c9.io, name it whatever you like and complete the setup
